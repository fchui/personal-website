# Dockerized Personal Website: Vite - Express.js - PostgreSQL - nginx - certbot

Dockerized website for quick deployment featuring full-stack with database. Designed to be hosted with VPS and to deploy upon startup. 

Below is a representation of the systems involved:

The front end communicates with the Backend API to fetch Project data from the database, all within their respective Docker containers connected by a network.

The current code aims to showcase my profile to anybody interested in it.

There is a heavy usage of Mantine library to display UI elements.

Feel free to use my code as your own.

The website is in active development.
